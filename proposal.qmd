## Research Goal

To build a predictive model that identifies women at risk of cervical cancer using demographic, social and behavioral history as well as clinical factors from the UCI Cervical Cancer Risk Factors dataset.

## Motivation

While the prevalence of Cervical cancer has decreased considerably in the past decade, it continues to be a significant global health problem, especially in low-income settings (@gopalkrishnan2025cervical). Besides geographical differences, age-specific differences in cervical cancer incidence continue to persist (@Islami2019trends, @Gargano2025trends). Further, there is a strong socioeconomic gradient for both the risk and outcome of cervical cancer, with those belonging to lower-income and marginalized groups having a higher incidence and mortality due to limited access to healthcare, education, and preventive interventions (@Singh2023cervical). Early identification of high-risk individuals can facilitate timely intervention and can appreciably decrease mortality. This project proposes to create a data-driven, machine learningâ€“based predictive model to evaluate the risk of cervical cancer based on established risk factors of age, sexual history, contraceptive use, smoking, STD history, and socioeconomic indicators.

## Questions

The rationale for this study stems from the fact that, while HPV vaccination significantly reduces the risk of cervical cancer, routine screening remains essential for early detection, even among vaccinated individuals, due to incomplete vaccine coverage, and the continued incidence of HPV-related cancers. Cervical cancer can still occur in older women who were never vaccinated and in younger women despite vaccination, highlighting the age variability in diagnosis, and the continuous monitoring of at-risk individuals. Therefore, there is a need to explore non-invasive, cost-effective alternatives to biopsy for early detection to improve outcomes, enhance accessibility, and support screening across diverse age groups.

1.  Can we accurately predict cervical cancer biopsy outcomes using only non-invasive risk factors and lifestyle history?
2.  Which factor contribute the most to cervical cancer risk?

## Ethical Consideration

The data source does not explicitly state whether there was informed consent by participants for their data to be made publicly available, nor how the data was anonymized. Moreso, including children under 18 in research presents unique ethical challenges due to their limited autonomy and capacity for informed consent. Unauthorized use of sensitive medical data can be a violation of ethical standards, i.e., as established under HIPAA (U.S.) (@Edemekong2025HIPAA). Further Even when anonymized, misuse of this data can reinforce harmful stereotypes or biases, especially against women, sexual minorities, or certain cultural groups, because the dataset includes intimate and potentially stigmatizing information. More importantly, behavioral factors in the dataset (e.g., sexual behavior, contraceptive use) have different social meanings across cultures. Thus, a contextual interpretation is necessary.

## Dataset

```{python}
#| label: load-dataset
#| message: false

def load_data(path):
  """
  Load data and print a data information

  Parameter:
     Path:Str
     Path to the CSV file to be loaded
  
  return:
     DataFrame 
  """
  #load data and store in df
  df = pd.read_csv(path, na_values='?') #consider '?' to be missing
  
  #return dataframe
  return df

data = load_data('data/risk_factors_cervical_cancer.csv')

```

For this study, we will be utilizing data from the [UCI Cervical Cancer Risk Factors dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/383/cervical+cancer+risk+factors) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data is best suited for this analysis because it was collected at a limited resource setting in Hospital Universitario de Caracas' in Caracas, Venezuela. It contains both demographic and behavioral data for women, along with results from four different cervical cancer screening tests: Hinselmann, Schiller, Cytology, Biopsy. Our goal is to assess patterns that lead to positive biopsy results, which is the most definitive screening measure for cervical cancer.

This dataset was selected because it reflects real-world medical data of low social economic setting, with a variety of relevant features, including lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, contraception), prior medical diagnoses, and social determinants of health. Overall, the total number of attributes in the dataset is `{python} data.shape[1]`

## Overview of the data

### Target Variable

The target variable is the result of the biopsy test, which is the most definitive indicator for cervical cancer in this dataset. It is a binary variable: 1 indicates cancer detected, 0 indicates no cancer. Below is the information about the target variable:

```{python}
#| label: target-info
#| message: false
#| echo: false

# Information on target
target_col = data.columns[-1]

target_summary = pd.DataFrame({
    'Column Name': [target_col],
    'Non-Null Count': [data[target_col].notnull().sum()],
    'Data Type': [data[target_col].dtype]
})

display(target_summary)
```

### Covariates

Possible covarites to be included are age, number of pregnancies, age at first intercourse, smoking history, contraception use, STD history. Below are the information about these variables:

```{python}
#| label: covariate-info
#| message: false
#| echo: false

# Information on covariates
covariates = pd.DataFrame({
    'Column Name': data.iloc[:, 0:32].columns,
    'Non-Null Count': data.iloc[:, 0:32].notnull().sum().values,
    'Data Type': data.iloc[:, 0:32].dtypes.values
})

display(covariates)
```

## Study Population

The population for this study consists of `{python} data.shape[0]` female patients from the Hospital Universitario de Caracas in Caracas, Venezuela. The majority of the patients (approximately `{python} int(round((data['Biopsy'] == 0).mean() * 100))`%) have a negative biopsy result, suggestive of a potential imbalance in the distribution of cancer diagnosis [Figure @fig-figure-1]. The patient ages range from `{python} data['Age'].min()` to `{python} data['Age'].max()`, with a notable right-skewed distribution, indicating a larger representation of younger individuals in the sample [Figure @fig-figure-2].

### Distribution of the target variable

```{python}
#| label: fig-figure-1
#| fig-cap:  "Distribution of Biopsy Results in the Cohort"
#| message: false
#| echo: false

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.countplot(x='Biopsy', data=data)
plt.title('Distribution of the Biopsy in the Cohort')
plt.xlabel('Biopsy Result (0: No, 1: Yes)')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```

### Distribution of the Age in the Cohort

```{python}
#| label: fig-figure-2
#| fig-cap:  "Distribution of Age in the Cohort"
#| message: false
#| echo: false

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.violinplot(x='Age', data=data)
plt.title('Distribution of the Age in the Cohort')
plt.ylabel('Age')
plt.show()
```

## Analysis Plan

Missing values will be evaluated and imputed using multiple strategies like the mean/mode imputation, KNN imputation, multiple imputation or completed removal depending on missingness patterns. Variables will transformed, normalized and encode appropriately. We will apply different classification algorithms and compare them using cross-validation and performance metrics like ROC-AUC, F1-Score, Precision, Recall to determine the best model. Proposed algorithms include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine.

For Feature importance and interpretation, we will use SHAP values for interpretability and visualize the top contributing risk factors.

## Proposed Timeline
