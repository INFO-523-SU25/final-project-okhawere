Categorical features were one-hot encoded.\n\n2.  **Class Imbalance**: **SMOTE** was applied to the training data to deal with class imbalance.\n\n3.  **Evaluation**: A stratified **train(60%)/validation(20%)/test split(20%)** was used to ensure an unbiased evaluation of the final model.\n\n4.  **Models:** Logistics Regression, Random Forests, XGboost\n\n## Baseline Model - Reported CV means (Average Precision)\n\n::: {#0fc98c41 .cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/cell-4-output-1.png){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Validation Leaderbaord (Average Precision)\n\n::: {#8b90c353 .cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/cell-5-output-1.png){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Test Evaluation (Logistic Regression Model)\n\n::: {#5a34ced8 .cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/cell-6-output-1.png){}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nPR-AUC: 0.145 | ROC-AUC: 0.629\nRecall (Sens): 0.364 | Specificity: 0.814\nPrecision (PPV): 0.121 | Accuracy: 0.784\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Feature Importance (SHAP Analysis)\n\n:::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n-   Hormonal Contraceptives (years) was the strongest driver.\n-   STDs: Number of diagnoses.\n-   Longer years since first intercourse\n-   Age: older age trends up.\n-   Recent STD :Time since last diagnosis.\n-   Number of pregnancies increase the risk\n:::\n::::\n\n# Conclusion\n\n-   The model is not a definitive diagnostic tool but rather a triage aid to prioritize patients for further screening\n-   **Future Work:**\n    -   The model's performance could be improved with a larger, more balanced dataset\n    -   Theoretical and biologically plausible clinical features, like HPV genotype or cytology, can lift the signal\n    -   Additional feature engineering and domain expertise could further enhance predictive power\n\n## Limitations\n\n-   Lack of Generalizability\n-   Modest Sensitivity (Recall)\n-   Moderate Predictive Power\n-   Data Imbalance: Despite using SMOTE\n-   Limited Feature Set\n\n## Thank You!\n\n",
